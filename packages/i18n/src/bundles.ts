 * The SHIPPED FALLBACK CATALOGUE — every user-facing key the client surfaces

 * (CLAUDE.md rule 38).
 *
 * It lives here rather than in each surface for two reasons:
 *  - mWeb and native must be identical (rule 27), and two hand-kept copies of
 *    the same `mweb.*` copy is exactly how they drift apart;
 *  - the admin panel seeds Localization > Translations from this registry, so
 *    a key added here is offered for translation without anyone re-typing it.
 *
 * Each surface still SHIPS its bundle — it re-exports the slice it renders, so
 * the copy is compiled into that build and available offline.
