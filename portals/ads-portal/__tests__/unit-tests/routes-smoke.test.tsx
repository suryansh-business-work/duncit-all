/**
 * Route smoke: every route in this portal is mounted with NO data behind it.
 *
 * Apollo answers nothing here on purpose. That is the state every page is in
 * for its first paint and for the whole of a slow or failed request, so a page
 * that throws instead of showing its loading or empty view is white-screening a
 * real user — and nothing else in this suite mounts most of these pages at all.
 *
 * The chrome is stubbed to a pass-through: the header, sidebar and breadcrumbs
 * belong to @duncit/shell and are covered by that package's own suite, so
 * mounting them here would test the shell once per route instead of the pages.
 *
 * ROUTES is generated from the route table in src/App.tsx.

 * no control on any screen may throw when it is pressed with no data behind it.
 *
 * The list is taken once, from document.body rather than the container, because
 * MUI renders a dialog into its own portal outside the tree under test. Nodes a
 * click detaches are simply no longer in the document, and firing at them is a
 * no-op, so the walk cannot loop. The cap keeps a page with a hundred row
